# Introduction

## Key Features
- Set the presentation language to German using `lang: de` in the YAML
- `\R` returns the \R logo
- Use external references by `zref-path: path/to/referenced/document`
- Change the grade of shading for code chunks using `shadecolor: X` where $X \in [0, 1]$
- For more YAML options check the underlying `template.tex` or visit [R\nbs{}Markdown:\nbs{}The\nbs{}Definitive Guide](http://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html)
- Using ~ for non breaking spaces does not work within this template. Instead use the new command `\\nbs{}` like above. 
- Add the university towers as a gradient background to the titlepage: `towers: true`.


## Key Features
- Start new sections by using one hash, use two hashes to create a new frame.
- Frames are automatically closed when you start a new one.
- Frame subtitles can be inserted by using standard \TeX notation `\framesubtitle{}`.
- If you want an enumerated list using letters, use

\bigskip
```
\begin{description}
\item[a]
\item[b]
...
\end{description}
```

## Key Features
\framesubtitle{Additional to the pandoc beamer template}

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
block-style: "blank"   # set block environments to be blank
shadecolor: 0.93       # shade of grey for chunk backgrounds ([0, 1])
lang: "en"             # change the language of the document (en or de)
zref-path: "path/to/file"   # import labels from external file
towers: true           # Title page background
```


## R Setup
The file `includes/r/setup.r` defines and sets several chunk options and constants that make it easier to incorporate R code and its output.

- You can also shade R output by using the new chunk option `shadeoutput = T`.
- Changing the font size used for a certain chunk can be change by e.g. `fontsize = "\\scriptsize"` where you can insert any \LaTeX \nbs font command.
- The three corporate colors are available in the list `due.col`.




## Code Chunks
\framesubtitle{Plots}

On the next slide is a basic R plot. It uses the same font as the document itself since we use the tikz device as a default!

- The slide dimensions are accessible through slide.width and slide.height. If you need to resize a plot, use the chunk options `fig.width` and/or `fig.asp`.
- I redefined `fig.width` to be defined as the share of the slide width (0, 1). `fig.height` is computed as `fig.width * fig.asp`.
- Several arguments to par() are set to default values, so that a single plot fits nicely to a slide.

## Code Chunks
\framesubtitle{Plots}

```{r Plot1, fig.cap = "Miles per gallon for different car models."}
plot(mtcars$mpg, ylab = "Miles per gallon")
```


## Code Chunks
\framesubtitle{Inline code chunks}

Inline code chunks are generated as follows:


```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
`pi`      This would not be evaluated but formatted with \\texttt
`r pi`    This is evaluated
```

Both chunks in action: `pi` = `r pi`.


## Block Environments

You can use some user defined block environments, suited for lecture scripts. A new theorem is created using

```
\thmn[optional title]
Theorem Content
\endthmn
```

\thmn[A great theorem]
... with zero content.
\endthmn



## Block Environments
If you specify the title to be an asterisk (*), the block is assumed to be a continuation of the last block:

\thmn[*]
This is a continuation of the last block.
\endthmn

\thmn
- A theorem with no title.
- Notice the empty line (123) after the list item. Without it, one would receive an error!

\endthmn



## Block Environments

Other predefined blocks are

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
\lem  ... \endlem   # Lemma
\cor  ... \endcor   # Corollary
\defn ... \enddefn  # Definition
\ass  ... \endass   # Assumption
\rem  ... \endrem   # Remark
\xmpl ... \endxmpl  # Example
\que  ... \endque   # Question
```

- You could still use `\begin{thmn} ... \end{thmn}` but then references and code chunks are not properly formatted because pandoc will ignore the content inbetween these two commands.
- If you want blocks with no background colors, use the YAML option `block-style: blank`.


## Citations

- Include references using the YAML option as seen above.
- Cite using the markdown syntax found at [RStudio - RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html#citations)
- `[@R]` returns [@R]
- The references are automatically added to the last frame. Therefore you should end your presentation with a frame named like `## References`.

## Modifications

- If you want to further modify your slides, then make the changes inside `includes/template.tex`.
- Most of the additional code that was added to the default pandoc template is annotated.
